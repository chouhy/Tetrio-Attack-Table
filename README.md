# Tetrio-Attack-Table S1
You know that [Tetrio combo table picture](https://tetris.wiki/TETR.IO#Mechanics) is wrong?

Now, you can get correct attack table here. https://chouhy.github.io/Tetrio-Attack-Table/
# Example
TSpinDouble b2bx2 combo1 should be sending 7 lines not 6.

TSpinDouble b2bx3-7 combo1 should be sending 8 lines not 7.

Actually the column of combo1+b2b is pretty much all wrong.
